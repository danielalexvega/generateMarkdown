# TEST

    ##Description

    TEST is a high-functioning replica of the SAT, as seen through the eyes of an overachieving student. Our algorithms take into account all factors, including, but not limited to, temperature; humidity; sound levels in the room (measured in dB), the amount of sleep the student had the previous night, the time of day, the time of year, the type of shoe the student is wearing, and more. This project will most likly change everything we know about everything. Anything you thought you knew, is now complete and total garbage. Throw that away in the trash.

    ## Usage Information
    Rule number one of test is not to tell anyone about test. You did not download it from us. If you get jammed up don't mention our names. As far as we're concerned, we were hanging out late at a bar in a rough part of Detroit, and you bought a round, and then we bought a round, and one thing led to another. Either way, you have to program now, and we have a strange story and bad taste in our mouth. We haven't been that hungover since 1987.

    ## Test Instructions
    Make sure your shoes are tied. I can't stress this enough. You might have to start running, so make sure you're not wearing flip-flops. Use a number 2 pencil. Show all your work. Don't erase anything. Unless you made a particularly bad mistake, then by all means, erase that. Wait till you hear the beep.  You have 48 hours to complete the exam.
